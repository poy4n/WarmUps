# DanChat

Daniel is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

He answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.
He answers 'Whatever.' if you tell him something.
He answers 'Woah, chill out!' if you yell at him (ALL CAPS).
He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.

Write code in `ruby` so that you can have an interactive conversation with Daniel.
Make sure you include some testing in order to verify your code.

## Hints

`gets`, _get string_ is the opposite of `puts` _put string_.

Notice that when you type "Something" and then hit enter, you get the string
`"Something\n"`

```
loop do
  # talk to Daniel here
end
