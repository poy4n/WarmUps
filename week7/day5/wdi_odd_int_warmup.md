# The Odd Integer Warmup

You have an array of integers. Find the integer that appears an odd number of times.

There will **always** be only **one** integer that appears an odd number of times.

For Example:
`[20,1,-1,2,-2,3,3,5,5,1,2,4,20,4,-1,-2,5]`, answer is `5` since it is the only number that appears an odd number of times.
