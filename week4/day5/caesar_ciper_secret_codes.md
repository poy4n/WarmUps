# can you break the secret code?

Write a program to decode this message:

**NQRZOHGJH LV OLPLWHG. LPDJLQDWLRQ HQFLUFOHV WKH ZRUOG.**

This is a form of cryptography known as the Caesar Ciper. It has a **shift parameter** of **3**.

The alphabet is normally:

```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
```

The alphabet with the shift parameter of 3 is now as follows:

```
DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC
```

which means if the original message is `HELLO`. The encrypted message will be `KHOOR`

```
H -> K
E -> H
L -> O
L -> O
O -> R
```

## decode the second secret message:

**ERQXV ILIWHHQ PLQXWHV EUHDN**
