# Mini Golf

Bob, Jimbo and Fish love mini golf. But, every time they hand in their score cards none of the scores are ever totalled. Write a function called `totalScores` in JS that calculates their scores and `console.log` the total for each player and their combined total.

#### Bob
- Hole 1 = 3
- Hole 2 = 2
- Hole 3 = 6
- Hole 4 = 11
- Hole 5 = 9
- Hole 6 = 2
- Hole 7 = 6
- Hole 8 = 9
- Hole 9 = 10


#### Jimbo
- Hole 1 = 5
- Hole 2 = 12
- Hole 3 = 9
- Hole 4 = 22
- Hole 5 = 13
- Hole 6 = 7
- Hole 7 = 16
- Hole 8 = 10
- Hole 9 = 11

#### Fish
- Hole 1 = 2
- Hole 2 = 2
- Hole 3 = 4
- Hole 4 = 5
- Hole 5 = 4
- Hole 6 = 3
- Hole 7 = 6
- Hole 8 = 4
- Hole 9 = 1

## Extension
Now work out each golfers round compared to the course par.

#### Par
- Hole 1 = 3
- Hole 2 = 4
- Hole 3 = 5
- Hole 4 = 5
- Hole 5 = 3
- Hole 6 = 3
- Hole 7 = 4
- Hole 8 = 3
- Hole 9 = 5

#### Ninja Extension
Fish loves a punt. Having placed a $1 bet on each stroke over par that Bob and Jimbo played per hole calculate his winnings.
